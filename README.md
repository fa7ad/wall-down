Download Wallpapers from reddit

The wallpapers will be grabbed from these subreddits:
* /r/wallpapers
* /r/gmbwallpapers
* /r/OffensiveWallpapers

This branch of the app uses [nwjs](https://nwjs.io)(as opposed to electron).

**WARNING!** This app is just my attempt at making a nwjs app, may/may not work properly. No Warranties whatsoever.
